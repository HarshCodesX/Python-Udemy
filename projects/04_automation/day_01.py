 Challenge: File Sorter by Type

Goal:
- Scan the current folder (or a user-provided folder)
- Move files into subfolders based on their type:
    - .pdf → PDFs/
    - .jpg, .jpeg, .png → Images/
    - .txt → TextFiles/
    - Others → Others/
- Create folders if they don't exist
- Ignore folders during the move

Teaches: File system operations, automation, file handling with `os` and `shutil`
